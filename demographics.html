    <p>Some of the places that we would seel our product are in suburban cities. We would sell our product here because there will be a higher chance for the people living here to be able to afford our product.The people that live in these in these areas will be able to know how to use the device better than most people. We would not be able to seel our product in places like Africa, where they do not have the necessary technology to use our product.
      </p>

       <p>We want our tech to reach all, but as you may know that is statistically speaking  it's an impossibility because of the finite resources that the planet posses. Our goal is more realistic than that what we want is for our product to reach the people who have the means to obtain it. Meaning that not everyone will be able to use our device even though we want everyone to be able to use it.
