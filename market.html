<h1>Target Market</h1>
<p>The Target Market for this product are the 40 some million people who suffer from disabilities that rob them of their life. Especially those of them who are paralyzed or cannot move their body anymore. The reason for this is because they may not be able to move their bodies, but their brain is still fully intact. We do this because we want those people to be able to live their life and be able to be with their family. Our products strives to give back the true meaning of living for these people, not just survive and simply wait to die. We also support the disabled gamers community and want them to play their games on the same starting line as the other gamers in the world, with nothing holding them back.
