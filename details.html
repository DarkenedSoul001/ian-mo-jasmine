    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Neural oscillation, are patterns of neural activity in the central nervous system, otherwise known as BrainWaves. Similar to most things that can produce data it can be researched, which will then be compiled into a database that will be used in our product. This data will consist of the many activities that go on in a human brain ranging from simple things such as making facial expressions to thinking of advanced maneuvering in a game. This neural activity will then be recognized by our device and will transmit the information to an Avatar in the digital space that will be imitating the desired action. To put it simple, you can be inside digital space.</p>
        
    <h2>What evidence do I have to back my product?</h2>
        <p>A research was conducted by Harvard University testing the EEG products to their limits, and the information they found was astonishing. This was, “the first noninvasive brain-to-brain interface (BBI) between a human… and a rat.” (Anthony) In this experiment, they were able to communicate to the rat to move its tail when the man gave the signal. This amount of control done to the rat is but a fraction of what we need to control an avatar in virtual space. Which covers the control aspect of the human to device portion of its features.

    <h2>You can taste food?</h2>
        <p>Another feature the device provides the users are the ability to taste virtual cuisine.  Studies were conducted in digital taste interface in the early 2000s, which proved unsuccessful because it needed chemicals to produce the taste. Which isn't a very practical cause there would be high maintenance for such products. Although, in 2014 it was successfully completed in the National University of Singapore, where they make use of electrodes to create stimulations to the tongue giving sensations such as bitter and sweet and many more.
