<h1>Impacts</h1>
<h2>Positive Impacts</h2>
    <img src="http://placehold.it/500x500" alt="replace me">
<p>One positive social impact is that people who are paralyzed will be able to communicate with the Digital Plane Field. They will be able to do this because we will be using the brainâ€™s electrical signals. Another positive social impact is that the person using Digital Plane Field will be able to interact with people; being able to communicate with the world. By being able to interact with people they will be able to feel like they have a voice again. The people using our product will not feel left out of anything because they will have a say in basically anything.
</p>
<p>Another positive but that it is cultural is that by going inside the Digital Field Plane, anyone can use it. By doing this everyone can interact with each other and people using our product can make more friends that they might have right now. Having friends makes a person feel less alone. Friends are also some of the most important thing everyone needs in their life.
</p>
<h2>Negative Impacts</h2>
<p>A big negative impact would be on the social habits of the next generation. By being exposed to technology that would make them have less of a need to interact with people may cause them to seize to talking to people altogether. By having such a technology many people and possibly children will most likely rather be on the Digital Plane Field than to be talking to someone in the real world. The culture will be bent more towards technology and we will begin to have less natural things with us. There will be less communication with people not using the Digital Plane Field.
</p>
<p>	One negative economic impact is that the product will be expensive for people that do not live where they have the necessary technology. Many people would want to use our product but unfortunately because of the location they will not be able to afford our product.
